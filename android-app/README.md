# Instruction on how to run the android app

## Build the project locally

1) Download the latest Android Studio: https://developer.android.com/studio
2) Clone the project and open current folder in the Android Studio
3) Click the `Run` button to automatically build the debug version and launch it on the emulator device

## Download and install the app on your android device (supports android 8+)

1) If you have previously installed the app, delete it completely from the device
2) Locate the folder `/app/release` or `/app/debug`. In the `release` folder you will find the release
   build (that is minified and have logs turned off). In the `debug` folder you will find the debug build (that is not minified and has logs enabled)
3) Download the chosen `apk` file and install it
4) Launch the app
